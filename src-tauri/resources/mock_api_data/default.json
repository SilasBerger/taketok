I couldn\u2019t figure out how everyone else was leaving at contract time.  If I could go back in time and give my new teacher self some advice\u2026it would be to SIMPLIFY!!  Since simplifying to whole group classroom management, whole group instruction, and a focus on building classroom community, my entire world has changed.  I can leave at contract time without having to bring home papers to grade or unfinished lesson plans.  My students have also responded so much better to these simplified systems and it has made classroom management so much easier.  #elementaryteachertok #teachertipsandtricks #wholegroupinstruction #classroomculturematters #classroommanagementhacks #wholegroupclassroommanagement #advicefromateacher #classroomsystems ",

When my students began to struggle with motivation to complete work and stay on task, I knew something had to change.  Then, I introduced Friday Folders.  These are basically a way to hold students accountable to complete work & motivate them with a fun STEM challenge or science activity every Friday.  Every student had their own folder that I managed in my filing cabinet. If they did not complete an assignment, they put their work in their Friday Folder to finish at a later time.  I have independent time built into my day, so students were allowed to work on Friday Folders during this time or anytime they finished another assignment early.  If Friday Folders were empty at the end of the day on Friday (the last 15-20 minutes) of the day, the students were able to join the Fun Friday activity.  Some of the activities we did were: homemade lava lamps, marshmallow catapults, marshmallow/spaghetti towers, ice cream in a bag, pool noodle launchers, design a maze with straws, etc. I tried to keep it simple, fun, & inexpensive.  I introduced the activity at the beginning of the week so students knew what they were working toward. It really helped with increasing motivation & work completion.  #classroommanagement #elementaryteachertok #teachertipsandtricks #classroommanagementhacks #classroommanagementtips #teachershareideas ",

I also recommend keeping a consistent routine: kids come in -> warm up -> go over warm up -> read -> mini lesson/go over directions/model -> independent practice -> reflect. **At my current school, we don\u2019t independent read every day in class, but have instead dedicated Fridays to be our in-class \u201creading workshop\u201d day following First Chapter Friday.  Obviously, some days are different depending on the activity, but I make sure to model my expectations and I have a slide on the board with a checklist of what I want them to accomplish.  Being intentional about your class time and being over prepared really makes a difference. I also take time to go over appropriate things they can do if they were to finish early. In my class they have 2 options: read (they are required to always have an independent reading book on them) or continue working on one of their free writes.

Und ich wei\u00df, dass es im Spanischen total komplex ist, w\u00e4hrend man in Spanien zum Beispiel fast niemanden sieht, ist es in vielen L\u00e4ndern Lateinamerikas eigentlich die Standardanrede, wenn man Menschen sieht. Und im Deutschen ist das halt nochmal anders. Es ist wirklich verwirrend f\u00fcr viele, sogar f\u00fcr viele deutsche Muttersprachler. Und wenn ihr nach Deutschland kommt, m\u00fcsst ihr unbedingt ein bisschen mehr dar\u00fcber lernen, wann man sieht und wann man dutzt. Grunds\u00e4tzlich k\u00f6nnt ihr euch vielleicht merken, wenn ihr eine fremde Person trefft, ist es immer besser, sicherheitshalber die Person zu Siedzen, gerade dann, wenn diese Person \u00e4lter ist als ihr."

        "transcript": "Have the players sit in a circle of chairs, alternating teams. Designate four of the chairs to be the couch. The game starts with one empty spot on the left side of the couch. Have everyone write their name on a scrap of paper and place all of the names into a bowl. Then randomly distribute these names back to the players. The goal of this game is to fill all four seats of the couch with members of your team. Whoever has the empty seat on their left will call out the name of somebody in the circle. The person that drew that name will then get up and then move to the empty seat. Play continues by once again having the person with the empty seat on their left call out a name. Now the tricky part of this game is that the names that the players drew in the beginning have become their new names for the duration of this game. So when you call Sarah, actual Sarah is likely not the person who is coming to sit next to you. So as you learn everyone's new names, your goal will be to try to pull people from the other team off of the couch, put people from your own team onto the couch, while trying to keep all of the jumbled names together in your head. And when the whole couch is filled with members of your team, you win."

So sieht das Theorieblatt von % aus. Lernvideos erstelle ich hier mit meinem iPad und meinem Apple Pencil. Um ein Lernvideo zu erstellen, arbeite ich mit der Bildschirmaufnahme, welche im iPad integriert ist. Das ist dieses Symbol hier. Ich klicke immer zuerst l\u00e4nger drauf, um zu schauen, dass das Mikrofon ein ist. Denn es ist mir schon passiert, dass ich ein ganzes Lernvideo aufgenommen habe, ohne dass das Mikro ein war. Und ja, dazu muss ich wohl nicht mehr sagen. Nun kann der Spa\u00df beginnen. Entweder ich klicke direkt auf Aufnahmestarten oder ich kann auch einfach da kurz drauf klicken. Sobald nun dieses rote Zeichen aufleuchtet, nimmt es meine Stimme, weil das Mikrofon ein ist, beziehungsweise auch alles, was ich darauf schreibe und zeige auf. Ich habe die PDF-Datei \u00fcbrigens im App GoodNotes drin. Da habe ich alle meine Theorieeintr\u00e4ge drin. So sieht das dann aus. Einen wichtigen Hinweis habe ich noch. Es macht mir Sinn, dass man Queerformat aufnimmt, da die Kids ja auf dem Laptop das anschauen und so ein gr\u00f6\u00dferes Bild haben. Nun kann ich hier mit dem Laser-Point zeigen, wo ich mich gerade befinde. Die Kids sehen nat\u00fcrlich den Stift nicht, aber diesen roten Punkt. Dann kann ich markieren, schreiben und eben gleichzeitig dazu erkl\u00e4ren. Ich kann ja da schnell was schreiben, damit ihr das sehen k\u00f6nnt. Oder markieren. Da kann ich nat\u00fcrlich auch andere Farben aussuchen. So. Und dann am Schluss, wenn ich fertig bin, dann klick ich wieder auf dieses rote Zeichen. Dann stoppe ich die Bildschirmaufnahme und jetzt speichert es mir dieses Video in den Fotos. Und so habe ich dann mein L\u00e4rdenvideo."

Up here is a number one, a lowercase l and a capital I, though not in the order that I just said it. Down here is an o and a zero, or maybe it's the other way around, I don't know. They look different in some fonts, in some fonts they're exactly the same and you will never know which one you're looking at. And if you say, well that's awfully confusing, why did you do it that way? That is the lesson. We didn't do any of this on purpose. It kind of just wound up like this. We're sorry. But what you need to know today is that if you ever accidentally substitute that for that in the wrong situation, it could ruin the life of yourself and everyone you know. As we proceed with your education, you're going to run into a lot of this. It's very confusing. It's not your fault. Don't let it make you feel stupid."

I picked one from Elements, but you can use one of your own photos and make it the same size as your page. Then you're gonna click Effects, Background Remover, and once that's removed, you're gonna pick the same photo again and make sure that you make it exactly the same size as you did the first time. Then you can drag your first image down to reveal the background, or if you don't wanna go down, you can drag it across.

And you have kids come to you at the end of the semester and say, why did you give me blank grade? First of all, I always tell them, I didn't give you a grade. This is the grade you earned, I just reported the grade. And so I went to a training and actually what I learned there was to do an accountability sheet. So let me show you what an accountability sheet is because I keep them from every single kid. accountability sheets. Let me show you what they look like. Okay, here's what they look like and I'll link these. See, this asks, what grade do you think you can earn? Why and how can you make sure that you earn this grade? Students said, do the work with my best effort, study my notes, stay off my phone for most of class, ask for help. The reason I keep these and where it gets fun is when students at the end of the semester say, why did you give me this grade? A little handy folders. I pull this out and I go over it with them. I said, did you stay off your phone? This one's always going to be a no for most kids. Did you stay off your phone for the majority of class? No. Okay. Did you do the work with your best effort? Well, no. Okay. Did you study your notes? No. Did you ask for help when you needed to? No. You see where this is going. Kids literally have their own words used against them because I'm convinced, middle and high school at least, they know what's expected. They know how to get the grade. And then they've kind of learned some responsibility and accountability for the grade they've earned. That's my pro tip."

I love this because I'm able to greet them with a smile on my face and set the tone for the class and also check in with anyone if I need to. It welcomes them into our learning space and shows them that I am there and I am watching. Two, I narrate the behavior that I want to see. Allie walked right to her seat and is working on her digital planner. Marlene is silently starting the warm up. And three, I have my students do the same exact thing every single day when they come into class. My entry slides have not changed since September. Keeping things predictable means they know what is expected of them, so they are more than likely to do it. What else would you add to this list?"

I love talking about classroom management and classroom culture, so if that interests you, follow along. You can set your expectation at the door. So before students even come in, make sure you give them clear directions, have them repeat those directions back to you. I do this the first two weeks of school, no matter what. You're going to silently walk in the classroom, open your Chromebook, and begin your warm-up. This way, your expectation is clear. The very first time a student doesn't do it the way the expectation was stated, you have them try again. We all have that student who loves to walk into class singing, right? Oh, say their name, come back, try again. If many students in your class have walked in the wrong way, stop the entire class and reset. Yes, I mean, have everybody line up and try again. Now, you want to try to keep this positive, so it's way better to stop and have them try again when it's just a few students versus the entire class. And keep that language positive. Tell your students you know they can do better than that. Have them remind you of the expectation, say, let's try it again. I know we're going to do it right this time."

So what I have been doing all of this year, I have been making all of my plans on Google Slides so that I have them all in one spot. There's not a bunch of different files and I start each week with a cute little side. And then what I have been doing is I'll print out the plans at the end of each week and I'll pop it into my binder. So I have a binder for first quarter, second quarter, we're in the third quarter right now and this is what the binder will look like. You can get these binders anywhere. And then what I'll do is I'll print the plans so the plans are right here and then I will pop in all of the master copies that I need for that week based on the plans that are right in the front of the little sheet protector. So I have all my weeks plans for the third quarter all in here. So that next year when third quarter comes around I can look at these. All my master copies are in one place. I don't know about you but the thought of having to file things away by standards, by topic and then go and look for them next year stresses me out. Knowing that I already have these whole binders with everything that I need in them is amazing and I know I'm going to thank myself so much next year for doing this and having this ready to go."

        "transcript": "One of the most important classroom norms you can set at the beginning of the year is when to use certain voice levels. It's really important to me that my students are talking with one another right away on the first day of school, so that means I need to teach them voice levels. I keep mine very simple, 0, 1, 2, 3. Before we do anything, we go over when each voice level is appropriate and we model each voice level. So I'll model it for them, I'll have students model it for the class, and then we practice. This works really well with turn and talk. Then before I have my students do literally anything, I review the voice level and check their understanding. What voice level shall we be at when we're doing independent work? Someone raises their hand and says 0. Great, show me 0 so I know you're ready to get started. Okay, begin. What's the right voice level for turning and talking with a partner? 1. What does a 1 sound like? I'll do that a lot in the beginning of the year. Okay, begin. I have 2 for group work and 3 for class presentations, but you honestly don't even need them. You really need 0, 1, 2, in my opinion. Oh, and before you all ask, I have taught 4th through 7th, so this has been appropriate for the great levels that I teach."

        "transcript": "Super easy maths game for any year level. It's called ladders. My year four class was playing it today. I'll show you how to play. You need a whiteboard, marker, dice. You draw your ladder and it's helpful to have one of these counting sheets as a visual. So we roll the dice and the highest possible number is 66. So since we've got 65, we're gonna put it at the top of the ladder and then we indicate on the sheet that there's not many numbers above 65. So that's why we put it at the top of the ladder. The goal is to correctly place the numbers on the ladder. So it involves a bit of critical thinking skills, teachers, comparing and ordering. Same as 14, the lowest possible number is 11. So we look at what's below it and what's above it and it informs our decision. As the game goes on, the kids really have to strategize and think where should I put my number? So if 26 comes up, most will put it next to 14 because they know that there's a lot of numbers between 26 and 65. But you do have those kids that are risky and they really want to try and get that number in between. I teach the kids by playing with them as a class and then we increase the difficulty. We add more ladder steps. We might add more dice to make it three and four digit numbers. They just really enjoy versing a friend or their teacher."

I'm like, okay, I didn't know I was in the presence of a genius, look at you. Then I make sure to let them know that I really am proud of them, even if it seems like it's something that's the bare minimum. Or even if they come to me and they're like, you are never gonna guess what happened. I finish what I'm doing and I'm like, what? They tell me and I make sure to always overreact. I'm like, she did not. But on the other hand, kids love to be dramatic. So I'll be sitting at my desk and inevitably some kid will be like, Ms. Volk, she's trying to kill me. And I'm like, well, I gotta go sometime. I guess this is your time. You're like, Ms. Volk, she's touching me. My response is like, don't be weird. Ms. Volk, my finger hurts.

I do just want to say a couple of things. I teach middle school, so I teach these routines typically as they come up. I don't just take a whole class period to go over my routines. Another important thing to think about is modeling those routines with your students and actually practicing them. I have a video somewhere about interactive modeling from responsive classroom that's really helpful if you're struggling with thinking through this. And my last thing is sometimes these feel really tedious and they're boring to teach. But if you lay this groundwork in the beginning of the year with your students, you are going to get so much time back throughout the year. You're going to have to redirect them and reset a lot less when you start off on a strong foot. And here's the list. Again, teachers, add what I forgot."

I'm the kid that is least lovable, the most trouble-sum, the most annoying, and very publicly during class. Figure out reasons that you should love them, reasons they should love themselves, and reasons they should be loved by others. It's kind of like prison rules, but way more compassionate and empathetic. Never been to prison. The moment that you win that kid over, every child in the room will have your back. Because they see it. They go class to class and see how that kid is treated like an inconvenience. Also see the compassion and effort that you put towards the kid that they don't necessarily deem as worthy of that effort. Every child in that room adores you for being the leader that they always wanted. To get it twisted, this doesn't mean to decrease your standards. It's an convenience to up your compassion.

I talk about classroom management and classroom culture, so if that interests you follow along. One, be yourself. It doesn't matter that you're young. Kids are receptive. If you're trying to be someone that you're not, they will know. They will respect you more when you're authentic. Two, build relationships with them, but you're not their friend. I find that this is kind of a hard boundary when you're first starting out. One of the best ways to do this is to be fair and to be consistent. If you want them to take you seriously, be serious about what you say. If you say you're going to do something, whether it's a promise, whether it's a consequence, whether it's a phone call home, actually follow through. If you follow through right away the first time, they will know that you mean what you say. No empty threats, especially when it comes to behavior management. Lines like, if you do that again, I'm going to follow up with consequence, just aren't that effective. Teacher friends, add your tips in the comments."

Hi I'm Jen, I love talking about classroom management and classroom community so if that interests you follow along. Here are three ways I use structured movement as a classroom management tool. One, gallery walks. I absolutely love them. I use them in math all of the time. You cut out a bunch of problems, you put them around the room and students can walk around as they work. It builds momentum, it gets them working and moving and feeling like they have a task to accomplish. Two, I use clock partners all of the time. This just gives them a couple of minutes to get up out of their seat and go connect with someone who's not in their immediate vicinity. And three, I love playing four corners. Use the four corners of the room and connect them to your content area. Have students go to different corners of the room if they agree with the statement, if they got a certain answer and then have them talk to one another or debate.

When students need to come up with a review question, they think we'll really stump their classmates.

These are BlurQ cubes. We all have these. We use them for math, but you can actually use them for classroom management. And so basically she would give the couple friends that were working on this in her classroom five cubes at the beginning of the day. Whenever they would BlurQ, she would just kind of go like that or signal to them and they would owe her a cube. You could give them three, five, ten, however many you think that they would need. If they still had at least one cube by the middle of the day, again, you could differentiate this. You could do end of the day. Then they would earn some sort of predetermined reward that they had already picked out that was like meaningful to them and motivating to them. If they didn't have five by the middle of the day, then there was no consequence. They just didn't get the prize and they started over for the afternoon. I just really like this because it's easy. Like there's no prep for this. It's very subtle. Like the kids can't even tell that you're holding the cubes and sometimes it's a good reminder to actually have it in their hands."

Every time a student completes an assignment, they put their name on a square and it gets colored in. When we fill up all the squares, I'm going to do a random number generator. And whatever number it tells me, I'm going to look at the corresponding box with the student's name in it. And that student will get a prize. The idea is the more homework assignments they do, the greater the chance that they're going to win the homework lottery. It has done wonders for my class. I told my kids that I was going to pick somewhere between three and five winners, which motivated them even more. Super fun, super easy, and super motivating. Some of the prize ideas I have are king-size candy bars, homework passes, and like a $5 gift card to either Starbucks or Chick-fil-A. Let me know if you try this out in your classroom."

If you've never heard of the website tango You seriously need to try it tango is a free website Perfect for teachers who are sick of repeating the instructions over and over again It records and captures screenshots of the tabs that you are on in the workflow that you're doing in this workflow I'm showing off some of the cool features of brain pop and things that I want my students to do so I know I did not know Brain pop has little checkpoints where students can answer questions I learned that as I was filming this video and now I'm obsessed I can't wait to try it wanted my students to create a brain map on brain pop with the video that I've assigned them But they've never done that before so that's why I use tango and it was key my students and I'll ask me a single Question during this lesson as you can see tango is capturing step-by-step Instructions on the side as I'm going through my workflow that I want my students to complete also another side note If you haven't used brain pops make a map feature you need to it's really cool Once I'm done tango takes me to the completed workflow where I can make any edits that I need to you can change any word choice You can delete out items that you're like, they don't need that much clarification. It's perfect You can publish this as a PDF to your student also as a presentation or just as a live link where they can see exactly what you're seeing right now This is why I truly think it's one of the best and underrated teacher resources check it out or so"

        "transcript": "Consequences have a time and place in a classroom, right? But not all consequences are created equal. Hi, I'm Jen. I talk about classroom management and classroom culture, so if that interests you, follow along. Responsive classroom is a really good framework for logical consequences. A consequence that is logical actually teaches the student how to fix the behavior. They're broken up into three categories. The first is break it, fix it. This means if you break something, you are responsible for fixing it. If you spill something, you are responsible for cleaning it up. If you draw on your desk, you are responsible for cleaning that desk. Another category is space and time, and this one for me is huge in a middle school. Maybe there's a designated area that the student goes, or maybe you tell that student you're going to check in with them after a designated amount of time. Give them the time that they need to recollect themselves and join the school community. And the third one is loss of privilege. These are not listed in any order or anything. So this means that whatever it is that the student is doing or misusing, let's say they're misusing their technology, they are no longer allowed to use that technology for a certain chunk of time. Maybe a class period or the day. It is important that the student is able to earn that opportunity back. Now, in general, when it comes to consequences, like a lot of us have different behavior management systems, point systems, class competitions, things like that that we use. Some are mandated by our schools. Whatever it is, there are a few things you should keep in mind. One, be consistent. As long as you are giving them consistently and fairly, they will work. The other thing to think about is to lean more in a positive direction than a negative direction. So I try to reinforce positive behaviors way more frequently than give consequences for negative behaviors. And one other thing I think it's important for students to have an opportunity to show that they've learned from their mistake and earn back whatever it is that you took away. At least the first time. That was a long one. Teachers, add everything you have to say about consequences in the comments."

        "transcript": "Here is a quick and enjoyable game to help your children learn their spellings. I like to call the game spelling shower and all you'll need are some torn up pieces of scrap paper, big enough so the children can write the words on but small enough so you're not wasting paper. You will then ask the children to write a certain word on their piece of paper. So for example it might be accident. They need to write the word on the piece of paper and then once they've written the word and they think it's spelled correctly without showing anybody they fold the piece of paper up into a tiny ball. I have to remind my learners not to fold it too small because it has to be unfolded later on. When everybody is ready and all their pieces are folded up into a small ball on the count of three I will ask the learners to throw it into the centre of the classroom. Now obviously this does require a little bit of behaviour management and it also depends on the logistics of your classroom. I'm lucky enough to have quite a big space in the middle where I can do this safely. Once all pieces of paper are thrown into the middle I will then ask each table to come up and choose a new piece of paper, preferably not the one that they threw and it is their job to unfold the piece of paper and check the spelling. If they think it's spelled correctly then they just give it a tick. If they think it's spelled incorrectly then they have to rewrite the spelling underneath. I will then give the learners the correct spelling and we like to play it on a point system so we do first of three and if all learners got the spelling correct without any of it having to be changed or altered then they get a point and if some of the spellings had to be changed and they weren't spelled correctly the first time then I get a point and if the learners get to three first then they all get a house point each."

The worst thing we can do is if somebody is acting in a way that isn't productive for them or helpful for them and it's not out of a safety need or something like that, give them more of us because then we're reinforcing what's going on. Right? If it's safety need, absolutely. They don't feel safe emotionally, physically, mentally. Then yes, we need to give them more support. But if not, then you remove."

I love talking about classroom management and classroom community, so if that interests you, follow along. So first, this is just good practice all year long, but to chunk your activities, like, don't make any activity longer than 20 minutes, especially direct instruction. Students are tiring more quickly, especially with testing and that end-of-the-year feeling. Two, I try to add movement as much as I can in my class. They are squirrely. I'm going to lean in. Changing up their partners for corners, working in a different location. Gallery walks are a personal favorite. And three, this one is honestly the hardest one, but it is to not get that end-of-the-year feeling myself. When I start to give up on upholding our systems and routines, they start to fall apart. So I have to hold myself and my students accountable just like I would if it were October. Teachers, what else would you add to this list? Leave it in the comments."

        "transcript": "Do you have any tips for building respect and kindness in students? Supporting our students and becoming more respectful and more kind is so important, but it is seriously so hard. Hi, I'm Jen. I love talking about classroom management and classroom community, so if that interests you, follow along. So the first thing I'm going to do in this video is just address kindness in class, and then I'm going to share some really good resources for explicitly teaching, kindness, respect, and empathy. So to start, one of the most important and easiest things we can do is model kindness. So being really intentional with our interactions with our students, with other people on our school campus, and showing them what it looks like to be kind. Next, I think it's important to think about what you do when you hear unkind words come from your students in your classroom. So I always try to address it right away, like if I hear anything in the beginning of the year, I address it right away and just say something like, we don't use those kinds of words in our classroom or whatever the situation is. Then I think it's important to circle back with the student who said the unkind thing and try to get to the bottom of why they said what they said. So I'll ask them why they said what they said and ask if they've ever been on the receiving ends of words like that. And I circle back to the student who may have received the unkind word. I do feel more successful in this category as a teacher when I take the time to explicitly teach kindness and empathy. So I'm going to show you some resources that I have used and will continue to use in the future. The first is learnkindfromkindness.org. They have a whole kindness curriculum, completely free from grades K to 8. The next is the Morningside Center for Teaching Social Responsibility. They have a lot of really awesome lessons, SEL lessons. And my favorite thing actually is their Teachable Moment lessons. Those Teachable Moments are a growing resource. So whenever something kind of like happens in the world, there's usually a lesson for how to talk to your students about it. Another resource I really love is the Responsive Advisory Meeting Book. There are lessons for like every single day of the year that focus on kindness, empathy and community building. That's specific for middle school students. I think you could probably like use some of them in high school and they have a bunch of morning meeting stuff for elementary school students. Okay, and I do just want to say one more thing about this topic. Sorry, this is my longest video ever, but we could talk about this all day. It's hard to see the growth, especially when it comes to like building empathy and kindness and respect. And I just try to remind myself that I am one teacher on their long journey in school, right, this 13-year K-12 journey. And that I just have to have faith that when I am consistent and when I constantly present them with opportunities to show kindness, that something is going to stick. And even if they don't show it now, they'll be able to draw upon it in the years to come. Maybe I just say that to help me sleep at night, but I do think it's important to keep that in mind. We put so much pressure on ourselves and we just have to be consistent and do what we can. If you made it this far, teachers, share your kindness, respect building, empathy, all of that fun SEL stuff, all those resources in the comments. And thank you."

I was so worried that I wouldn't be able to control a classroom because I'm so softly spoken. It didn't take me long to realise though that having a big powerful teaching voice really wasn't that necessary. I discovered the power of using non-verbal behaviour management strategies. I turned the volume down so it's not too loud and so it doesn't annoy the teacher next door. Every classroom gets noisy. This is a great way of getting your students attention without having to raise your voice or yell."

        "transcript": "A couple months ago, I started my teacher drive. And if you don't know what that is, it's where I'm compiling all of my resources that I share here on TikTok. And I have taught sixth grade, seventh grade, and eighth grade. I am just wrapping up my fifth year of teaching. And I've been adding a little bit each week. And so I wanted to show you all the new things that are in my folders. And again, the reason that I'm doing this is because I really didn't feel like I had a lot of support when I first went into the classroom. And some schools will have a full-blown curriculum. And so you could use these kind of as supplemental things, like I have projects. I have just different handouts that you would toss in on top of a curriculum. But if you don't have any curriculum at all, which like the school that I'm currently at doesn't have a set textbook that we use, it doesn't have a set curriculum, which I personally love because I'm able to really personalize it to meet the needs of my students. But that can be very, very intimidating if you are just going into the classroom. I will say that my drive would be perfect for, I would say as low as fourth grade up through high school. So let me show you what's in it. And then let me know if you need any more information on it. Okay, so here's a glimpse into what's in my teacher drive. And I've sorted everything as best as I can into folders. I do have some assignments that are just kind of like loose out here. I have my year at a glance, which is everything I taught this year in seventh grade. I have some other handouts. I have projects. But let me go up to some of the folders. Some of the folders have a lot of resources in them because I've spent a little bit more time adding. So this is my argumentative unit. So I have all my handouts. I have my example essays. I have my slide shows. I have literally everything. I have all of my back to school activities. And again, you would be able to make copies of these and personalize them however you would like. I have a lot of book resources for you guys. So this is especially good if you are new to middle school. So I have my book flicks, which you've probably seen around my classroom. I have all of my first chapter Friday. So again, you would click on it. And then it would take you to like the different slideshows. And so all of these things you can make copies of, all of my book recommendations. I have all of my poetry resources, which includes my March Madness brackets. I have seriously so many things in here. And I just want to be as helpful as possible. So I'll keep adding to it. I also have different resources that go with our class books. So we read Chains in the Spring. So I have all of our notes on there. I could keep clicking through, but each folder has at least a few resources in them. And like I said, I'm still adding. And then what might be really helpful because obviously these are just resources and you might not know exactly how I use them in my classroom. So I did pin a video that has links to all of my different TikTok videos. So that way you can see like, how do I actually use these with my middle schoolers? You guys are able to utilize these different resources. The reason I made them was because I would post a resource video and I would get upward of two, 300 emails, not even joking from people asking for the resource. And it was just a little bit too much for me to keep up with. So now every time I post a video, I will also be updating my drive. So you guys can get access to it."

Like I can identify the text structure, but I didn't understand how that would help them understand the article on a deeper level until I made the connection between text structure and main idea. And now everything has clicked. Because I teach text structure differently now, now my students understand that the purpose of text structure is to help them organize the details and to figure out the main idea. One of the biggest ways that I have changed the way that I teach nonfiction now is that I always start with five articles on the same topic. It happens to be a topic that I love, which is pangolins. And so all of these articles are written in a different text structure, but they're all on the same topic. This helps students see that main idea is not the same as topic. It also helps them see that when we organize information by the text structure, by looking at the keywords and an organizer, we can very clearly see what the main idea and the key details are. This then helps them to write a summary. I have these five pangolin articles and a couple little activities that go with it to help them figure out main idea for free at the link in my bio. And I have a whole nonfiction text structure unit with organizers and little anchor charts and things like this and a ton of other articles if you're interested on my TPP store."

This one is so simple, but it works. These are my students' math books for period one and period two. I just have the post-it to protect my students' names. Every single day, the first two students who come to class distribute the math books. When there are two minutes left of class and I pack up students, they simply plop their books back in the bin, which is right by the door, on their way to their next class. When you keep the location of things in mind, when you create routines that are predictable and convenient, they will stick throughout the year.

I felt like I was bending over backwards, but the growth just wasn't there for the time that I was putting into everything.

So, say if you type in the word happy and you hit enter, it's going to show you how that word happy connects to other words. All of the lines mean something different and there's a key on the left and it also shows you the part of speech that each of the words. If you hover over it's going to give you a dictionary definition and if you double click it, it's going to expand the word further and show you how it connects. And that way you can really explore the words to your liking. Enjoy, bye!"

Here's an example. We were learning about how to use commas. Then this activity evolved. I would dictate a story and students wrote this down in their notebooks. And loved the color blue. After each sentence, I would share it on the screen. There's something to be said about retention for having the students write it down so they understand the rules of grammar and punctuation. Let me know if you try it. Follow from our teacher tips."

When waiting's not working and they're just carrying on talking, then there's actually things that you need to do differently that I've learnt and I'm going to tell you what they are now. Number one, set my mutually specific expectations at the start of the year. These are our general overview, but for every routine we have the expectations are so explicit. If you haven't done that and you're partway through the year, it's not too late, but it will just take more work. Number two, if they get those expectations wrong, repeat and practice. Do this ten times for a skill if necessary. I don't care if it takes your entire lesson. It is more important. Number three, use warm eyes, thumbs up, positive praise with those that are noticing and eyeball those that aren't. Body language, tone and expression are your friends. Number four, mix up the way you're giving instructions. I really like typing on the screen and I've seen some people mention that whispering is great too. Number five, do not talk unless it is silent. Otherwise, you're training them that it's okay. I'll make heaps more videos about how to be a softly spoken teacher and still manage effectively because that's what I'm passionate about. So follow along if that's you."

        "transcript": "One of my favorite things I did this year that I will definitely be doing next year because it saved me so much time and energy is my binder system. So all of my students have a binder for my class and they keep it in my room. And it has all of the work that they've done for my class throughout the whole year. All of the notes that they've taken, all of the assignments they've done, all the writing pieces that they've done, their bell ringers, everything is in here. And it's all in like the correct sections and whatnot. Instead of me constantly collecting papers and then grading them and then passing them back at the end of every week, I go through their binders, I'll grade their bell ringers, I'll grade any bigger assignments we did, projects because it's all in here. And then I will leave a grade on that actual sheet and on a post-it note, I will write them a little note of something that they're doing well, something that they can improve on, and just a little affirmation. So then after I write their little binder note, I'll stick it on the inside and then next time they go to open up their binder, it's the first thing that they'll see. And I just do this because it's so important to let your students know when you see their progress. This is a great way for me to check in with my students and see all their work together and just communicate to them that I see that they're making progress or if they're not making progress, I can check in with them and figure out what we can do to make it work. But yeah, I truly believe this system is the only thing that helped me stay organized and sane throughout my first year of teaching. I learned it from my cooperating teacher when I was student teaching and it's genius."

I reward them for following those directions. So before we ever start a lesson, they've already done the first four or five things that I've said, now they're ready to do those academic things too. So for example, I might call them over. When they come over, I say great job, you came right away. Now pick your marker. They pick the marker, great job, you picked the green one, awesome. I do that again and again and again. So when it's time for me to say what sound does this say, they already followed everything before that. They feel really good about following that, and they're much more likely to engage for me for the rest of the time."

So if that interests you, follow along. One really important thing for me to do at the beginning of the year, every year, is make some sort of contact with my students' families. I try to do this either before the school year starts or in the first couple weeks of school. I know we all teach a different number of students, so this is a little bit easier for some than for other. Hear me out. If you have a rapport with your students' families, their student is inevitably going to be more bought into school and what you're doing in your class. Your student is likely going to go home and say something about you to their family. By calling and reaching out first, you're able to make that first impression yourself. Establishing this rapport makes behavior calls later in the year so much easier to me. You know those phone calls where you have to introduce yourself to the student's family and then share with them some sort of negative behavior that you want to talk about. Those conversations are so much easier when you already have rapport with the parent and the families are a lot more receptive to what you have to say. Now like I said, if you have 150 students, this is nearly impossible, at least to do in the first couple of weeks. Maybe you could split up this work with a teammate or something like that. I'm just sharing from my experience that the years that I go out of my way to do this with my students and their families and actually welcome them back to the new school year, I just have much, much better years."

When the lesson is taught, I annotate the card with the date and then I use an arrow and tick system to indicate working towards achieving or working beyond. I also have a digital spreadsheet for summative assessment. However, you may like to include overall results to make comparisons just like this. You can also provide a section for notes to include strengths and next steps. Again, depending on what's expected of you in the reporting system.

But I realized for that to work, I have to be on point with the way I explain things, expectations, and even my lessons. In the beginning of the year, I'm explicitly modeling and teaching every single classroom routine that we have. Even something that you think students would already know, I teach it. So for example, how to get ready for math, how to get a tissue, what to do when you're done. All these things have to be shown and taught. After I do that, then I can really enforce these three rules. I like to keep it simple with just three rules that cover everything. For consequences, I like to use three strikes, warning, reset, which is like a timeout or parent contact. I also will use logical consequences. So if you're playing games on a Chromebook and we're supposed to be working, you put the Chromebook away. I ran out of time. So like and follow for part two."

So now I'm going to answer a lot of questions that you guys have been asking and luckily this commenter asked like all of them in one comment so I'm going to address them all. One, if you missed the video, every single Monday my students get a sheet that looks like this. Every single Friday they reflect on their learning, they turn it in and I grade it for effort. So that's like completion. My grade book literally has a section for academic grades and a section for effort grades and they get different grades on their report card. The warm-up questions in math at least are always spiral review. We go over them every single day so there is no cheating. I expect them to write the correct answer if they got it wrong. I also don't want my students doing nothing during the first five minutes so I circulate around the classroom to make sure they're doing their work. The moment the bell rings I use a timer that is appropriate based on how challenging the question is. Usually it's like three to five minutes max. I have an expectation in my classroom that when you walk into class you take out your Chromebook and your math science folder and your pencil no matter what. Those three things stay on top of your desk for the entire lesson. When my students are done with their warm-up I give them the very explicit and clear direction to put their warm-up sheet inside their math science folder. Because of this routine that I painstakingly built at the beginning of the year and reinforced throughout the year, my students don't really lose their warm-up pages. But if they do, I have a spot in the back of the classroom where they can simply pick up an additional warm-up, log back onto Google Classroom and find the questions from earlier in the week and they can still turn it in on Friday."

So when I first went into teaching I kind of had this philosophy that like I didn't want to have assigned seats for my students especially with English language arts like there's lots of opportunities for like genuine discussions and allowing students to turn and talk with the people around them and therefore I wanted them to be around people that they actually wanted to talk to but what I realized was that like 11 to 14 year olds they cannot regulate themselves and I promise you if you do a seating chart and then like you'll have some students ask like hey can I just go move and sit next to so and so like I promise they give the puppy dog eyes I promise I promise I will not talk and then sure enough they do and you're annoyed not at them but you're annoyed at yourself because you knew that they were going to talk and yet you still like gave them a chance and trust me on this because I have given so many different students even my best students the opportunities to sit next to their friends and it just it never works out and so when you're creating your classroom you want to think about how you're going to have success for the most students as possible and unfortunately if you let students sit next to one another sit next to their best friend and then they start talking they're distracting all the kids around them and then you're also having to waste precious time redirecting them to get them back on track so like now what I do is I do have a signed seating for my day-to-day but how I let them work with their friends is for group work or for partner work I almost like 90% of the time will let them choose their groups because to me if they're off task during a group assignment then that's on them then they'll they'll have to catch up and do it for homework or they're going to have to do it in their own time but they didn't you know negatively impact anybody else but if they're sitting next to their friends in class where it's disrupting the people around them or it's leading to any type of chaos then then that does negatively impact the learning environment so that's kind of how I've switched my philosophy from my first few years of teaching to kind of where I'm at now that I am you know going into my sixth year of teaching"

So something I do every Friday, it's called Freerite Friday. And I honestly got this idea from my sixth grade English teacher, you know, all those years ago, it really sparked a love of writing. And so I was like, I want to find a way that I can use it with my students in my classroom. So every Friday, I will post a prompt on our Google classroom and you could do this digitally or you could do this by hand. I like doing it digitally because I found that it was easier for me to grade than trying to grade 100, you know, plus notebooks that I have to carry around with me. So what the kids do is I post a prompt and then the kids will open up a Google Doc and they will just start writing. Sometimes about like 80 percent of the time, I will give them a challenge associated with it. So say that I just taught them simple versus compound versus complex sentences. I might say, OK, in your Freerite this week, I want you to try to embed one of each into your story. Or say that I just taught them how to punctuate dialogue. Then I might be like, OK, for your story this week, again, I'm giving them free reign of like what they do with the story. But I'm like, I want you to focus on the dialogue and make it really good. So it's my way to check all of the different standards that I'm teaching throughout the week. But they're able to show me their mastery of the skill in a very fun way. So the prompt that I did a couple of weeks ago was, OK, pick one of these three prompts, write a story about a family going on a road trip somewhere around the United States. You can pick how many kids and who is going on the road trip. Or number two, write a story that starts with what do you think is in there? Or the third option, write a story about finding a letter and trying to track down the owner. So again, they can pick one of those three. I also have had students that and this is what I did back when I was in sixth grade. I tried to keep the same going for the whole year. And so I have had several students that have been working on the same story throughout the entire year and we're on chapter like 30. And it is just so cool to see the kids going from the first week of school where they are struggling to write a paragraph to where they can just sit down for 45 minutes in like they don't want the time to end because they're so invested in what they're doing. I'm in the process of converting all of my prompts into one Google Slides presentation for you. So it's going to be my summer project. But as soon as I finish, I will put it up on my teacher drive. So you have access to it. But like I said, this is something that I love and look forward to doing every week. And it's my way to really like see how the kids are improving in their writing. But also I give them feedback and just to see them like blossom throughout the year and gain confidence in their writing. That to me is one of it's just so rewarding. And I hope that you're able to do it with your students, too."

        "transcript": "Three end of year tips to make your future teacher self happier. First, we want to declutter and recycle. I'm literally going through bins right now, figuring out what's worth keeping, what I haven't used, and what needs to go. Next, label everything. You're going to put everything away and everything's going to be in a place. And by the time August rolls around, you are absolutely going to forget where it is. So label it. Lastly, you may not be able to do this, but I always try to make sure my walls are ready to go. So I will spend the time at the end of the year. Obviously taking everything that needs to come down, down, and fixing any borders, fixing any paper, just making sure everything is ready to go. So at the beginning of the year, I'm not spending time setting up my room, setting up my walls."

        "transcript": "If there's one thing first-year teachers or anyone wanting to tighten up their behavior management in the next school year need to know, it's this. This book dedicates about a page and a half to talking about how to teach your kids your routines and procedures. They emphasize how you have to show, not tell, the kids about your rules and then let them show you and tell you why the rules are important. This has been a really valuable lesson I've learned over the years that one, you have to model and dissect your rules and procedures. Two, the kids need to practice and give and receive feedback on those rules and procedures. And three, you got to stick with consistently and fairly enforcing those rules and procedures all year. The book even mentions how kids will have you sniffed out right away on how picky you're going to be about those things and if you're actually going to enforce them. We always spend the first two weeks nailing down those routines in my classroom and prioritize brushing up as needed throughout the year. I've said it before but my classroom can literally run itself by October because my students have taken ownership over our rules because of the work they put into them at the beginning of the year. This shift was such a game changer for me, I hope it helps you too."

        "transcript": "Here are five engaging websites for students who finish early. All of these are cognitively challenging, fun, and require critical thinking. Number one is QuickDraw from Google. Google gives you a basic prompt and it tries to guess your drawing in 20 seconds. You motorcycle. Oh, I know. It's tractor. This is free to use, requires no login, and helps with machine learning research. The next website is beanbeanbean.com. This is a charity quiz game that is free to use and also requires no login. Full disclosure, there are ads. These quiz questions are answered correctly. Money gets donated to charities. It's funded exclusively by advertisements like this. Free rice is a similar website. For every correct answer, 10 grains of rice are donated for the UN World Food Program. Students answer random trivia questions, and as they answer the questions correctly, they gain more rice. Number four is scribblediffusion.com, where you can turn your sketch into a refined image using AI. So you draw an image, give it a description, press go, and then an AI tool generates an image based on your description and drawing. This is also a great way to introduce students to AI tools. Finally is the Chrome Music Lab. Just make sure students are using headphones because this gets noisy. There are a ton of different options for students to choose from, but just as an example, I'll show you what the song maker can do. Even without the knowledge of how to play an instrument, students can create melodies and loops. With the spectagram tool, students can create their own sounds or visualize sounds they make using their microphone. My name is Carly. I'm an instructional coach with a specialty in technology. So follow for more easy, low prep ideas like this."

        "transcript": "five teacher websites that I could not have lived without. First up is Padlet. My students love this one and we used it every day in my class. It's great for daily check-ins and there's a variety of ways you can utilize it for your content area. Slides Go! This one is a big time saver. If you want organized and overall just nice looking slides, Slides Go! will be your best run. They've still made templates to choose from and a majority of them are completely free. Next is Pear Deck. If you want your students to stay engaged and interact with your Google Slides presentation on their own devices, you'll love Pear Deck. In your presentation you can insert pre-made and completely editable slides where they can answer questions, draw, type, and more. Quizzes. Quizzes is really fun and can be used for all subjects. It's a game for reviewing learned concepts especially vocabulary. I always make sure to go over the answers with them at the end. Last is New CLA. Teaching ELA, this was one of my go-tos. I always loved how the articles are relevant with current events and how easy it is to assign to your students on paper and through Google Classroom."

        "transcript": "Okay, so at this point I've made a million videos about your entry routine and the value of having a warm-up. If you click on this comment, you'll see me explain a little bit more about this, but I added something to my Math Warm-Up Template based on this genius comment. Here's what the template looks like if you didn't already see it. Students write in these boxes each day of the week and the warm-up is on the board. Here's the reflection section where students reflect on their learning for the week, but here's what I added. So this is another option that I'm going to start using probably in the second week of school next year, where students can show their work when they first walk in, but then they can tell me if the answer was correct or not and correct their work in the space below. Thank you, Kelsey Ann. I love this idea."

        "transcript": "If you're a first-year teacher, stick around because I have some tips for you. These are things that either I loved that I did as a first-year teacher or that I wish I did as a first-year teacher. My first piece of advice would be if you are planning on doing some sort of classroom theme instead of going on to different stores and trying to buy all these items, that spends one a lot of money and it takes a lot of time. So I recommend on going to teachers, pay teachers and just buying a bundle. I bought my bundle off of learning with Kiki. She is on teachers, pay teachers. I get a lot of questions in my videos where my number line's from, where my alphabet's from, and that's all something that I purchased one time in a bundle. I paid about $60 for mine, which yeah, that might be a little expensive to some people, but it included everything, number line, alphabets, shapes, posters, decorations, all that kind of stuff, printable, customizable, and it's just a one-time purchase. My second piece of advice is start looking for items for your classroom now. You might think it's early in the summer and you have the hoist of the summer to do it, but honestly, the more you get for your first year, the better. I'm going around this summer and I'm hitting up different stores for all the teacher deals, so you can keep up with me or you can go ahead and check them out for yourselves, but a lot of stores have already set out all of their teaching items. One of the things I struggled with as being a first-year teacher was not having a full library of books. I went ahead and created an Amazon wish list and I shared it on Facebook, Instagram with all of my friends and family, and people who loved you and wanted to support you are able to donate to your future classroom. Creating an Amazon wish list is free and super easy. If you need ideas on what to put on your Amazon wish list, I have mine linked in my bio, so you can go ahead and check that out. I also recommend getting in contact with your co-teacher or co-teachers as soon as possible. These are going to be the people who you lean on a lot in your first year of teaching. I know I needed mine, but they are going to be able to answer any questions you have and help you make a smooth transition into the classroom. That takes me to my last point, which is try and get the curriculum over the summer. I wish I would have gotten my curriculum a little sooner and taken a little bit more time to look through it so I was a bit more prepared, but if you can start looking at your curriculum now, you are going to feel a lot more prepared and at ease when the start of the school year comes. I hope this video has helped you and has given you ideas on how you can start preparing before you actually enter the classroom. If you have any questions or if you want a part two, let me know down below. Have a great day!"

        "transcript": "Alright, if there's one thing I can recommend for primary teachers, I teach kindergarten, but for survival, you need to breathe breaths. You need to breathe, the kids need to breathe. Let me show you what I mean. This book is the Holy Grail. I think it's on Amazon. I'm not even kidding, this is a necessity. Alright, let me give you a few little examples here, okay? It's called Alpha Breath, and it literally goes through the entire alphabet and gives you a different type of breath for every letter. You know what I mean? And it's wonderful and so cute. It's like alligator breath, butterfly breath, cake and dolphin, and it even has a good description. It's like this one says breathe in as you imagine a cake and breathe out, blowing out the candles. The kids actually love the elevator breath, so you breathe to go into the top floor of your belly, breathe out going down to the bottom. We learn two new ones a day, and it's so cute, and I just read it to them. We have a very calm moment. Right now we're down to S and T, but every time we learn two new ones, I ask a couple volunteers to reference an old one, and we'll do two of the old ones before we learn two of the new ones. And when I tell you, it works like a charm. We're breathing all day. Class is too crazy. Pause. Let's take two dolphin breaths. Getting a little rowdy? Let's take three butterfly breaths. I love her. Biggest kinder tips."

        "transcript": "How to create your graduate teaching portfolio, part one. When collecting evidence, we are looking for quality over quantity. 10 pieces of quality evidence will cover all 37 of the Australian professional standards for teachers. So let's start with a lesson sequence. Five or more lessons that you've written. They can be from a university assignment or from one of your placements. Evidence should meet at minimum six of the standards. Inviting your annotation, it's important that you communicate how your evidence improved student learning outcomes, succinct and matter of fact tone. A sentence should clearly state what the evidence is. A lesson sequence, you'll need to state the year level, the key learning area and the topic. Then you'll need to reference how your piece of evidence met each of the standards listed. Crucial that you use the language of the standards to do this. Example, if you are referencing standard 3.4, select and use resources. In the Tation Codilklac, for example, I used these resources in my lesson sequence. List the resources there, include at least one form of ICT. Then go on to say that the resources selected increased student engagement, which was evident in, mention your informal observations, anecdotal notes, feedback from your mentor or examples of student work. The end, ensure you put 3.4 in brackets. It is clear to your assessor what standard you are referencing. In annotation for each standard should be at minimum two sentences and at maximum four sentences. No one has time to read a whole essay. If you found this helpful, let me know and I can create another video using a different type of evidence. Bye!"
